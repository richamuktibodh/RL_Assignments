Bartos, Sutton, Richard S., and Andrew G. Barto. Reinforcement learning: An introduction. MIT press, 2018.

## Assignment 1
Coded out the following algorithms:
1. Multi-armed bandit problem(epsilon-greedy)
2. 10-armed testbed
3. Gradient Bandit Algorithm
4. Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) Action Selection

## Assignment 2
Coded out the following algorithms:
1. Value Iteration
2. Policy Iteration (evaluation + improvement)

## Assignment 3
Coded out the following algorithms:
1. First Visit Monte Carlo
2. Every Visit Monte Carlo
3. Q-Learning
4. SARSA

Used the gym library to simulate the environment for Blackjack which used Monte Carlo methods to solve the problem.
